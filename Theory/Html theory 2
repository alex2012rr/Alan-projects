To understand HTML (HyperText Markup Language) fully, you have to view it as the skeleton of the web. It is a declarative language that uses a system of "marking up" content to tell a web browser how to display it.
​Here is the complete theoretical breakdown of HTML:

​1. The Anatomy of an Element

​An HTML element is the fundamental building block. Most elements consist of three parts:
​Opening Tag: <tagname> (e.g., <p>) - Marks the start of the element.
​Content: The actual text or media inside.
​Closing Tag: </tagname> (e.g., </p>) - Marks the end.
​Note: Some elements are "Void" or self-closing, meaning they have no content and no closing tag, such as <img>, <br>, or <input>.

​2. The Global Structure

​Every standard HTML5 document must follow this boilerplate logic:

<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    </body>
</html>

3. The Tree Logic (The DOM)

​The browser interprets HTML as a DOM (Document Object Model). This is a tree-like structure where:
​The Document is the root.
​Parents contain other elements (Children).
​Siblings are elements inside the same parent.
This hierarchy is crucial for applying styles (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript).
​4. Semantic HTML5
​Modern HTML theory emphasizes Semantics. Instead of using generic <div> (division) tags for everything, we use tags that describe the meaning of the content:
​<header>: Introduction or navigation.
​<main>: The dominant content of the page.
​<nav>: Navigation links.
​<article>: Independent, self-contained content.
​<footer>: Closing info, copyright, or contact.
​Why it matters: It helps Search Engines (SEO) understand your site and makes it accessible for screen readers used by people with visual impairments.
​5. Attributes: Adding Properties
​Attributes provide extra information about an element. They always appear in the opening tag:
| Attribute | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| href | Used in <a> to define a link's destination. |
| src | Used in <img> or <script> to point to a source file. |
| alt | Provides alternative text for images. |
| id | A unique identifier for a single element. |
| class | A non-unique identifier used to group elements for styling. |
​6. Block vs. Inline Elements
​Block-level: Always start on a new line and take up the full width available (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <div>, <ul>).
​Inline: Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., <span>, <a>, <strong>).
