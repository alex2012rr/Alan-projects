To learn HTML, think of it as the skeleton of a webpage. Everything is built using tags that wrap around content: <tag>Content</tag>.
​The Basic Structure
​Every HTML file must have this foundation to work correctly:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://google.com">This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>
Essential Tags for Exercises
​Headings: <h1> (main title) down to <h6> (smallest subtitle).
​Text: <p> for paragraphs, <b> or <strong> for bold, <i> or <em> for italics.
​Lists: <ul> (bullet points) or <ol> (numbered lists), with <li> for each item.
​Multimedia: <img src="image.jpg"> for images and <video> for clips.
​Containers: <div> (generic block) and <span> (inline text) used for layout and styling.
​Attributes
​Tags can have "settings" called attributes. These always go inside the opening tag:
​<a href="url">: href tells the link where to go.
​<img src="path" alt="description">: src is the image source and alt is a text description for accessibility.
​Pro Tip: Save your code in a file ending in .html (like index.html) and simply double-click it to see it in your browser.
